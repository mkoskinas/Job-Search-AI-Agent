# AI-Powered Job Search Assistant

## Overview

The AI Job Search Assistant is an interactive, multi-purpose application that helps users search for jobs in real time, analyse their CVs, and get advanced ATS (Application Tracking System) and Match scores œÑŒø improve their job application materials using AI and Large Language Models. Built on top of Gradio and LangChain with the support of OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo model, the system uses various custom tools to deliver a conversational experience. The assistant provides job search/filtering capabilites, offers advanced CV analysis and targeted improvement suggestions ‚Äî all while keeping a conversational memory for context.

## Description
This application is designed to act as a virtual job search and CV consultation assistant. It combines job searching through scraping LinkedIn job posts, advanced filtering via text vectorisation and similairty search, CV analysis with job description matching, and AI-powered recommendations to help job seekers optimise their applications.  

The key functionalities include:

- **New Job Discovery:**  
    The assistant scrapes job postings (e.g., from LinkedIn) and uses a vectoriser that indexes and stores the job data in a vectorstore. This indexing allows the assistant to later retrieve and rank job listings.
    
- **Existing Job Retrieval and Filtering:**  
    Once job listings have been stored, follow-up queries that refer to these listings automatically trigger a retriever tool. This tool performs a similarity search using vector-based methods. By comparing the user‚Äôs query against the indexed job listings (through semantic similarity on embeddings), the retriever efficiently filters and ranks the listings based on relevance, ensuring that the most appropriate job opportunities are returned.

- **CV Analysis and Enhancement:**
    - **CV Evaluation:**  
     The assistant employs a dedicated CV analyser tool to assess how well a candidate‚Äôs resume aligns with a provided job description. Users can upload their CVs (typically in PDF format), and the tool processes the document by extracting text and performing multi-dimensional analysis. It computes:

      - Keyword Matching Score: Measures the presence and frequency of both required and preferred keywords from the job description within the CV, providing a direct metric of skill and experience alignment using NLP (Spacy). 
      - Semantic Similarity Score: Utilises advanced embedding techniques to gauge the contextual and semantic closeness between the CV and the job description, ensuring that related skills and synonyms are accurately captured.
      - LLM (Language Model) Score: Leverages GPT-4 to evaluate overall clarity, structure, and relevance of the CV content, offering an additional layer of nuanced assessment.
      
      These individual scores are then combined into a composite ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score, along with further metrics such as structured analysis and detailed breakdowns of strengths and areas for improvement. The final output is a comprehensive report that presents an overall match percentage but also provides actionable insights for enhancing the CV.     
    - **Improvement Suggestions:**  
    After the initial analysis, the user is prompted for improvement suggestions. On confirmation, the CV enhancer tool provides targeted recommendations focusing on areas such as professional summary, work experience, skills, format, and achievements.

- **Conversational Interface:**  
  * A chat interface powered by Gradio allows users to interact naturally with the assistant
  * The system maintains conversation history via LangChain‚Äôs memory modules, ensuring contextual understanding and enabling coherent multi-turn interactions.
  
  Additional Features:
    * Text-to-Speech: The assistant can also read its responses aloud using OpenAI‚Äôs TTS capabilities.
    * File Handling: Users can upload CV files (PDF), which are processed and analysed
